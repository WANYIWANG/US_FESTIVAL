# us_festival

Statement of purpose & description:
This is an Adv Viz project about US endangerous festivals. In this visualization project, I want to show the United State’s various festival. Festival can illustrate different dimensions and cultures, like public holiday festival (vacation) or regional signature festival. By information visualization, I hope to offer a vivid ‘whole to part’ vision to help people learn more about the birthplaces, originating time and cultural background of different types of festivals in the United States. The visualization can be divided into three parts. The first part is a United state mapping that can display the overall festival distribution of the United States according to the type and month of festivals. The second part will allow viewers to click on the specific festival activity picture from part one to view the publisher and historical background. The third part will be an attribute chart based on the type of festival(Holiday, Food, Religious, etc.) in different regions.

Significance:
I understand my project as a narrative project that transfer text calendar or festival information on travel book into geolocation format. Compare and analyze different regions of the festival based on period or type. I design this visualization for travelers or people who interested in United States’ culture of the festival. I believe it’s a comprehensive method to display national by its festival and think about geographical features by festival celebrations.

Literature Review:
Festival is a formal cultural category that captures a range of public, collective and expressive activities. Religious in origin, festivals became secular in the early modern period when astute political actors from kings to revolutionaries began to map them onto political activity. The expressive of festival serves to give narrative form and emotional valence to people's life that characterizes the modern nation-state: an independent of ideological orientation. For the ongoing research on national and local region analysis, the organizer and historical background of the festival are very important.

Data:
Consider about outside resources. I need geospatial regional boundaries data (United State Census Bureau); Festival list data by types and time (Wikipedia); Public Holiday time and history data (Wikipedia); images of the festival (not necessary).

Methodology:
Because I wish to focus on the visualization part rather than data scraping part (important in this project too), I consider the final delivery first. After looking at different visualization samples, I realize I want to design an interactive dashboard or interface to tell a story from global to local view. I will use python to scraping data from Wikipedia and other data resources listed in bibliography, and use HTML, CSS, and Javascript (JQuery, D3.JS, Processing or Kapler) for the interface design and visualization display. I will try a way to get the best results.
